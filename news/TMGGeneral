If you are considering applying for a position, here is a collection of posts about the way we currently operate. By no means are those ways optimal nor even, in some cases, desirable, but they are for the better or worse reflective of the current situation.

- Pierre is not a good manager
- Group meeting
- Online and hybrid work 
- TMG Seminars & CNM Colloquia
- Hosting Speakers


First and foremost, it is important to know that I am *not* a good manager. This is not fake modesty either. 


We do not have a weekly/biweekly group meeting in the traditional sense. Part of it is from personal inclination, but also from avoiding the temptation of being stuck and not reaching out until the next meeting comes along. 



Instead, Pierre is the main organizer and host of the weekly TMG seminar on Wednesdays at 2pm. Seminars are held in a hybrid format in building 440 and online, and are broadcasted internally throughout Argonne. Access outside of the Argonne- and CNM-user- communities is not provided. 

Since Pierre took over the seminar in October 2019, the seminar has hosted ~35 speakers per year, with approximately 35% of the talks given by TMG junior members, ... 

The goals of this seminar series are to (1) increase the awareness of the theory and modeling group members (in particular junior members) towards contemporary research topics (2) train junior members of the TMG and Argonne community to give quality seminars in a colloquium/job interview format (3) satisfy Pierre's own scientific curiosity --in this order.   The TMG seminar takes a significant effort to run (typically 25 min of planning and 1h of attendance each week) and is done as a service to the postdoctoral, student, and CNM user communities. Attendance of group members is strongly encouraged.
